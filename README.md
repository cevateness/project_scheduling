#  Project Scheduling Optimization with RCPSP
A basic implementation of Resource-Constrained Project Scheduling Problem using PuLP


This repository contains an implementation of the Resource-Constrained Project Scheduling Problem (RCPSP) using PuLP, a linear programming library in Python. The goal is to optimize the scheduling of multiple projects with tasks, considering resource constraints, precedence relations, and project due dates.

## Features

- **Generate Project Data**: Create projects with tasks, durations, resource requirements, and precedence relations.
- **Optimize Schedule**: Solve the RCPSP to find the optimal schedule that minimizes the project makespan while respecting resource constraints.
- **Visualize Results**: Generate Gantt charts to visualize task schedules and worker load over time.
